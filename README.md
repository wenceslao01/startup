# HTML5 BootCamp base folders layout

Please, use this repository as a base for you training phase. The idea isht
fork this project so everyone use the same folder structure for the
exercises.

It's extremelly important to keep the key points easy to be verified by
the reviewers, so **don't mix the key points with the rest of the
exercises**

5. Install your own NodeJS server. 
  * Download [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
  * Install `http-server` globally, by running `npm install -g http-server`
  * To start the server, from a command line interface, run `http-server` in the directory where you will clone the startup repo
  * Open your web browser and point to localhost:PORT (the `http-server` should have outputted the number of PORT you should use)

6. Fork this repo https://github.com/bootcamp-bahia/startup to use as a base to host the project code.

→ [index](#index)

 

###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room. 

2. The next two weeks will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp HTML - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

###Proposed Test Applications

The test application will consist in a Last.fm client.

###Learning Days###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps; yeah, web apps! Web apps powered by the latest, and coolest toolkits, and techniques.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ####Read:####
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ####Practice:####
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. ####Commit:####
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

### Introduction

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/html5-css-javascript.png "The platform")

HTML describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. It allows to add dynamism to a web page, by supplying a way to have more control over user interaction, and allowing altering the document content that is displayed.

Now that you know which are the three pilars of a web application's UI, it's time to dive into them in more depth.

####[Topic 0: HTML & CSS Basics (5 days)](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-lab)

####Topic 1: JavaScript Intro and jQuery (1 day)####

#####Reading:#####

1. Beginners: Eloquent JavaScript [basic tutorial](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (in case you need it!)

2. Beginners: Have fun with [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/jquery-and-the-dom) (more experienced devs might find it fun!).

3. Recommended: [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html) 

4. Explore [jQuery documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page)

5. JavaScript Prototypes: [http://www.slideshare.net/Dmitry.Baranovskiy/demystifying-prototypes-6183470](http://www.slideshare.net/Dmitry.Baranovskiy/demystifying-prototypes-6183470)

#####Extra documentation:#####

* Web Platform Documentation Project: [http://www.webplatform.org/](http://www.webplatform.org/)

* MDN JavaScript Reference: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference)

* Annotated ECMAScript 5.1: [http://es5.github.com/](http://es5.github.com/)

#####Practice:#####

1. Create a basic index.html file. Use correct doctype, and tags. Add jQuery's latest version.

2. Add a stylesheet to the index.html. Use the stylesheet to center the text to all &lt;section&gt; elements of the page.

3. Add a hidden &lt;section&gt; with the following text inside: "Hello world". 

4. Add a button below the &lt;section&gt; to your index.html.

5. When the page has finished loading the section must fade in.

6. Add a textbox with the class "alias", and put the cursor inside it right after the &lt;section&gt; fades in.

7. Attach an event to the created button which calls a function that gets a response from [http://bootcamp.aws.af.cm/welcome/tunombre](http://bootcamp.aws.af.cm/welcome/tunombre)

8. Write the response to the &lt;section&gt; element.

9. Show &lt;section&gt; content in red when a server error occurs.

10. Take some free air and then create a function to highlight your name in the server response content. Call it right after setting the response inside the div.

11. AJAX: do a GET request to the local server [http://localhost:3000/search](http://localhost:3000/search) with parameter data "q=html5" to get the response.
First log the service response in Chrome's console to analyze data, then display tweets inside another section in the right side of the screen. The &lt;article&gt; element must be used to contain the Tweets.
For each tweet show: from_user, text, created_at, profile_image_url.

12. Add a transparent background covering the whole screen behind the tweets &lt;section&gt; so the background gets dimmed.

13. Validate your page using W3C validator: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/)

        </tr>
    </table>

2. Instantiate some of your favorite movies and play with them in the console.

3. Add a MovieObserver class that listens for "*playing*" and “*stopped*” events.

4. Publish "*playing*" event on Movie.play(). You should be able to do something like this in the console:
   
    ```js
    var terminator = new Movie();
    terminator.set('title', 'Terminator');
    // ...
    terminator.play(); // output: Playing Terminator...
    ```

5. Publish "*stopped*" event on Movie.stop().

6. Log to console when each event is fired.

7. Refactor Movie class as a Module keeping your previous code for reference.

8. Create a DownloadableMovie that extends from Movie adding a download` `method.

9. Create a  mixin object called Social with the methods: share(friendName) and like().

10. Apply the mixin to Movie object and play with the console output. You should be able to do something like this in the console:

    ```js
    var ironman2 = new Movie();
    ironman2.set('title', 'Iron Man 2');
    // ...
    ironman2.share('V. Rivas'); // output: Sharing Iron Man 2 with V. Rivas
    ```

11. Create an Actor class and create some actors from one of your favorite movies.

12. Show how you would add an array of actors to a Movie object.

3. Create the same Movie class as in the previous practice, but inside a module; the module will be an external file.

4. Create a Director class inside a module and set it as a dependency on the Movie module. 

5. Add name:string, a quotes:array properties, and a speak()methods to Director; calling speak() will return director’s quotes.

6. Add a Director to a Movie
You should be able to do something like this in the console:
    var alien = new Movie();
	...
	var ridleyScott = new Director(‘Ridley Scott’); //sets name in constructor
	ridleyScott.set('quotes', ['Cast is everything.', 'Do what ...']);
	alien.set('director', ridleyScott);
	alien.get('director').speak(); //output: Ridley Scott says: 'Cast is...'

7. Add jQuery as a module (hint: use the [shim](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-shim) support).
